This folder contains scripts that run integration tests over easy fuse.

Requirements to run the tests:
- To run these tests easy fuse Python package must be installed and available from the command line
- Shell scripts (ie: `run.sh`) must be called from the root of the repository as they contain relative paths

These tests, when possible, are integrated in the continuous integration environment.
